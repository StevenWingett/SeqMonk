Installing SeqMonk
-------------------

Windows
-------

Download the seqmonk zip file, and unzip it on your machine.  Windows has a 
virtual filesystem view of zip files which allows you to look at the contents in windows
explorer without actually unzipping the file - this isn't enough to run seqmonk, you need
to right click on the zip file and extract the contents to a conventional folder.  Once
you've done that just double click seqmonk.exe to run the program.

MacOS
-----

SeqMonk is distributed as a dmg file which is a virtual filesystem on a mac.  Just
download the dmg file and double click on it.  You will see the SeqMonk app appear in a 
finder window.  Simply drag it from there to somewhere on your machine to install the 
program.  Since seqmonk is not a signed application, the first time you want to launch it
right click (or control click) on the app and select Open (rather than double clicking). 
You should then be prompted as to whether you trust this application.  If you say yes then
you will be able to open it by double clicking in future.  If the app doesn't open then
go to your OS preferneces and look in the security section.  There will be a message saying
that the app was blocked, and giving you an option to unblock it.  Once you've done that
then it will work as normal.

Linux
-----

To run SeqMonk on linux you will need to install a java runtime environment on your
system.  This will already be there in many cases, but you should check.  You should find 
a program called Terminal or KTerm in your applications menu

At the command prompt type 'java -version' and press enter.  You should see something like:

	java version "1.8.0_60"
	Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_60-b27)
	Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.60-b23, mixed mode)

If you get an error then you don't have java installed.  If the version listed on the first
line is less than 1.8 then you won't be able to run SeqMonk without updating your JRE.

To install java on your system use your package manager.

On ubuntu/debian: sudo apt install default-jre
On centos/fedora: sudo yum install java-1.8.0-openjdk

If you are running Fedora then even if you see a java version on the command line SeqMonk still 
may not run because the version of java which is installed by default doesn't include any 
of the graphical  libraries.  You may need to install the full version of openjdk using the command
listed above.

Actually installing SeqMonk is as simple as unzipping the zip file it comes in into a
suitable location.  That's it.  Once unzipped it's ready to go.

You can use the seqmonk wrapper program to launch the program.  You will need to
make this file executable (chmod 755 seqmonk), and then ./seqmonk will launch the program.
If you link (don't copy) the seqmonk file into /usr/local/bin then you will be able to run
the program from anywhere on your system.  We have also included a seqmonk.desktop file
which you can use to register seqmonk with your desktop environment.  If you have put
the whole SeqMonk folder into /usr/local then you can simply copy the seqmonk.desktop file
to /usr/local/share/applications.  If you installed it elsewhere you'll need to edit the
paths in the desktop file (it's pretty obvious what to edit), and then copy the file to
the applications folder.


Configuring SeqMonk
--------------------
Before starting out using SeqMonk you may want to review the configuration options you
have for the program.  Information about configuration can be found in the help which 
comes with the program under Help > Contents > Configuration.

In particular you must set up a cache directory in order to allow the analysis of all
but the smallest of datasets.  Simply create a folder somewhere on your machine you are
able to temporarily write large amounts of data, and then use the button of the front
screen of seqmonk to tell it where to find this folder.


Configuring R
-------------
For some of the advanced statistical filters SeqMonk talks to a locally installed instance
of R to do the statistical analysis.  Configuring R is optional, and SeqMonk will run 
without it, but the R based filters will not be available.

To configure SeqMonk and R you first need to install R on your system.  R can be downloaded
from http://www.r-project.org/ and you should follow the instructions there to load it.

For OSX and Linux users the installation of some R packages will require that you have 
suitable development tools installed.  For OSX the easiest way to get these is to install the
OSX R Tools Package which can be found at:

https://github.com/coatless/r-macos-rtools

For Linux users you should install the normal build environment on your system.  Many systems
will have this already, but you can explicitly install them with:

Ubuntu: sudo apt install build-essential

CentOS: sudo yum groupinstall "Development tools"

In addition you may need to install some additional development libraries.  The exact set 
can change over time, but the one which often crops up is the xml2-dev library

Ubuntu: sudo apt install libxml2-dev

CentOS: sudo yum install libxml2-devel

SeqMonk should prompt you to identify the location of your R installation (if it's not
found automatically), and will attempt to install any packages it requires for you during
initial setup.
